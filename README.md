# Regional Equity  

This a "proof of concept" model demonstrating the incorporation of spatial distribution of health inequities into a system dynamics simulation model. The model uses the initial distribution of the 2021 Health Equity Index (left map) for Cuyahoga County, Ohio census tracts from [HealthyNeo](https://www.healthyneo.org/indexsuite/index/healthequity). The map on the right shows the simulated Health Inequity Index based on the policy set below.
